      <p>
        Hello! I’m a passionate full-stack developer, driven by a relentless
        desire to learn and excel as a top performer in any team I join. Beyond
        my professional life, I find joy in sports, particularly the NBA, as
        well as golfing and hiking in the beautiful Utah mountains. I bring both
        dedication and a collaborative spirit to everything I do, whether it’s
        coding or hitting the trails. Let’s build something great together!
      </p>
